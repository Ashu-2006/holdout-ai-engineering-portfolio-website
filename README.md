# Portfolio Site Template

A small personal portfolio built with [Astro](https://astro.build), Tailwind CSS 4, and [Motion](https://motion.dev). Your stuff lives in little folders — travel photos, projects, writing — that open up into full collections.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experiment. There are a lot of edge cases where it's not perfect, so expecta lot of rough edges. I have not tested this on phones, just made this, thought it looked good and deployed. If anyone wants to polish this - send a pr.
