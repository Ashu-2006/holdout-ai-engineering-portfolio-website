/**
 * The contribution year, generated once and shared.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE. The grid renders in two places now: the figure
 * on the home page and the lab at /playground/heatmap. A lab whose grid
 * is a second copy of the generator is a lab that can quietly disagree
 * with the thing it is supposed to be judging, so both read from here.
 *
 * MOCK DATA, seeded so a rebuild is byte-identical. Shaped like a real
 * student's year rather than uniform noise: quiet in exam weeks, dense
 * in the two project sprints, near-zero on most Sundays.
 *
 * THE DRAW ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Three calls to r() per day, always in
 * the same order (hit, level, count), even when an earlier result makes
 * a later one unused. Reordering them or short-circuiting a call
 * reshuffles every subsequent day, which changes the picture on the
 * home page. If you touch this loop, diff the rendered class list.
