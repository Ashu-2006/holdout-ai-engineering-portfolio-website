/**
 * Derived reads over Project.metric, shared by the playground
 * variations.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO:
 *
 * Four of the five variations want to show movement, "was 0.71, now
 * 0.89", because that is the comparison a reviewer is actually making
 * and the shipped design buries it inside a disclosure panel.
 *
 * The obvious implementation is a signed delta: parse both numbers,
 * subtract, render "+0.18" in green. That would be WRONG on this data
 * and the wrongness would be invisible:
 *
 *   - "539 / 3,300" against a baseline of "1,904" is an IMPROVEMENT of
 *     1,365 places, and a naive subtraction renders it as -1365 and
 *     colours it as a regression. Leaderboard rank is lower-is-better
 *     and nothing in the type says so.
 *   - "2.7x throughput" against "FP32 at 1.0x, 0.4pt accuracy cost"
 *     has two numbers in the baseline pointing opposite directions.
 *
 * A correct signed delta needs a `higherIsBetter` field on the metric
 * type. Adding one is a schema change to shipped data, so instead this
 * module renders the pair as FROM -> TO and performs no arithmetic. The
 * movement is visible, the direction is the reader's to judge, and no
 * number on the page is invented.
 *
 * If a variation here gets promoted, add `higherIsBetter: boolean` to
 * Project.metric and this file can compute properly.
